When i first time access GitKraken, i am really confused.
The first problem i met is that i fail to authentize my connection of GitKraken and Github.
I tried changing my broswer from IE into Firefox and connent the VPN. Then i secceeded.
During the tutorial I make a mess at the first time because i am cluseless about what everything.
The reason for it is that i pay excessive attention of why these words, like "clone", "repo" and "commit" means.
In this situation, i neglect the functions of these buttons and all the things are tangled up in my mind.
However, i deleted all my repos and redid these operations again, by exploring it by myself and discissed it with my friends.
This time, i understand.
Everything went smoothly. And i seccessfully finish all the operations.
questions:
What does 'fork' means exactly?
