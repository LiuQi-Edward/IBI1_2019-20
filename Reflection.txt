I really enjoy the practice classes, although sometimes the code was difficult. The most important thing i learnt throughout the class is not the usage of some functions and some methodologies, but i learnt how to get for help and how to efficiently ask questions (some specific websites, the manner of efficiently ask questions). I am a BMS student. Many years later, i might forget some of these functions. However, where/who should i turn for help will still exist in my mind. Also, i learnt the programming thinking mode which contains rigor, comprehensiveness and innovation. I could apply not only the python itself to my following study and research, but these right ways to search for hints and programming thinking mode can also be applied in thinking about biological world. "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. " can be the best proverb to sum my achievement.
